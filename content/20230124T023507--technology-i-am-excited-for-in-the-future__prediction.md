-   2 TB micro SD cards. [This has been done](https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/news/meet-the-worlds-first-2-terabyte-microsd-card) but are not commercial available, I am excited for this as this will be the smallest and most portable storage available. Useful for phones, laptops, drones, cameras, handheld gaming devices you name it.
    -   When will it come out: Probably late 2023 or 2024. Maximum 2025. I am hoping for a Sandisk version to buy when it comes out.
