Tech improvement in my computing lifetime (2007-)

-   more powerful CPUs and GPUs (which basically came about around this time?)

-   rise of ARM and RISC instruction set

-   bigger storage space available

-   online storage readily available

-   better battery life

-   encryption readily available (E2E cloud, full disk encyrption, E2E messaging in things like signal and whatsapp)

-   rise of modern and advanced text editing (neovim, VS code, emacs) and protocols around that (LSP, Treesitter)

-   rise of markdown in web forms (stackoverflow, reddit, pseudo-markdown in slack and discord)

-   rise of open web (RSS, IRC, fediverse, indieweb all growing in popularity)

-   rise of a lot of good open source things (OBS, Godot compared to bandicam and unity)

-   rise of the smartphone (GPS, camera and music player combined)

-   better and more powerful handhelds (steamdeck, which can emulate the consoles of my 2000s childhood)

-   better internet and celluar speeds

-   rise of drones

-   rise of chrome and powerful web standards (HTML5, Webasm): I know some might consider this to a be a iffy improvement.
